This is an interactive implementation of John Conway's game of life in python.

The build depends on pygame so you must install that if you want to run it yourself.
To build it just navigate to the directory of the files and do "python life.py"

I included assets which I made myself, those being the reset.png and the dice.png
You're free to use those if you wish, just credit me with a link to this github repo.
